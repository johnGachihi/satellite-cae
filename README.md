This repository contains the implementation of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and Context Autoencoders (CAE) for pretraining and fine-tuning on multi-spectral satellite imagery datasets, specifically for tasks such as flood mapping and land-use classification.

### 1. Project Overview

Name: Context Autoencoders for Pretraining Foundation Models for Satellite Imagery Tasks
Objective: Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of MAE and CAE pretraining strategies on multi-spectral satellite imagery for downstream tasks.
Datasets:
Pretraining: FMOW-Sentinel (Sentinel-2 imagery with 13 spectral bands).
Fine-tuning Tasks:
-Land-Use Classification: FMOW-Sentinel dataset (62 classes).
-Flood Mapping: Sen1Floods11 dataset.
